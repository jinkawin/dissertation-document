    \section{Motivation}

        Test citation ~\cite{BK08}.
        -	Why I choose social distancing detection – because Technology helps (become an important role) human in medical problems

            - Because technology, development, and research (not only computer, but also med/news/media), it was not cost damage/life/time as it should be.
                - Example, we have face pandemic for many times - including this year – COVID
                - And we know how to basically handle this problem
                    - we have found that social distancing is one way to reduce spread [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html]
                    - because, Social distancing has been recommended for many years (h1n1) [http://tinyurl.com/ycdxmxcl]
                    - Because Slow down and reduce peak graph [http://tinyurl.com/y94f37qg]
                - And we still developing and researching for this pandemic
            - It would be better if technology will help this problem in the future. It will gain advantages
                - Polices have to work hard to prevent people breaching the law during lockdown
                - Police or who are involving may be easier (if there is help with technology)
            - This project may not be the big step to help the world, but I want to be a part of improvement of technology (to help people)
        -	Why I choose mobile application
            - Mobile become popular device which people use for everything (such as receiving news, study or business purpose)
            - 1. Performance
                - One technology that has high competition -> high improvement is mobile
                - Since the first smartphone, it has been evolved a lot
                - It increases capability of phone (CPU, GPU, and Memory) which is able to perform many tasks as desktop computer
            - 2. Portability
                - No charger is needed during being used
                - Mobile have all needed function (camera, computation hardware - CPU)
                - Move computation part from server to device
            - 3. Can be enhance by parallel computing


    \section{Objectives}
        -	Android application is able to do social distancing detection by using Deep Neural Network (DNN)
        -	Able to do the task in parallel
        -	Use camera to detect in the real-time
