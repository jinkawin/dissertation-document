    \section{Distance Calculation}\label{sectionDistanceCalculation}
        According to Gurucharan \cite{SOCIAL-DISTANCING-DETECTION}, to measure a distance between 2 people, the reference point of people are used for calculation.
        The reference point is the coordination of each people, which is the centre of the detection frame.
        The calculation formula is based on Euclidean distance.

        \begin{equation*}
            d = \sqrt{(a_{0}-b_{0})^{2}+(D/c)\times(a_{1}-b_{1})^{2}}
        \end{equation*}

        \begin{equation*}
            c = \frac{a_{1}+b_{1}}{2}
        \end{equation*}

        However, three-dimensional space are captured into two-dimensional image, so depth and perspective are concerned.
        Thus, a couple variables are added into the formula.
        The first variable is $D$, which is the diagonal of the image.
        The second variable is $c$, which is a calibration.
        These 2 variables will determine the depth of people in the image.

            \label{distanceCalculation}
        \end{figure}

        For example, according to the figure \ref{distanceCalculation},
        if distance is calculated without calibration, distance between 2 couples will be the same.
        Naturally, the distance between Human1 and Human2 must be further than the distance between Human3 and Human4.

    \section{Existing Applications}
        1.	Object Detector
            -	250-300 ms per frame
            -	Live camera
        2.	Computer Vision Detection
            -	Don’t know about (ms per frame) or (frame per second)
            -	Live camera – not smooth
            -	Lots of features including face detection
            -	Problem is it still delay
