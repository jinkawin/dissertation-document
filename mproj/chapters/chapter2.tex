    Then, this chapter gives an analysis of related applications.

    \section{Detection Algorithm}
        \subsection{Deep Neural Network}
        -	People Detection
            - Using DNN
            - What is DNN
            - How it works
            - How it works in this project
                - Insert diagram of DNN (Flow of Image Processing)
                    - blobFronImage
                    - forward
                    - ...
        -	Distance Calculation
            - Explain about formula
                \begin{equation*}
                    d = \sqrt{(a_{0}-b_{0})^{2}+(D/c)\times(a_{1}-b_{1})^{2}}
                \end{equation*}

                \begin{equation*}
                    c = \frac{a_{1}+b_{1}}{2}
                \end{equation*}
                - C value (Calibation) -> perspective
                - Image diagonal line (550 -> (480x270))
                - Euclidean Distance
            - Insert picture for explination
        -	Lib
        -	Models

    \section{Mobile Technology}
        -	What is Android
            - An open source OS, support mobiles, tablets, watches, TVs, Cars’ system [http://tinyurl.com/yag8kyst]
        -	Android development
            - IDE -> Android studio which provides SDKs and tools
            - Native application -> Java and Kolin
            - Native language -> C and C++
                1.	For intensive application which require extra performance
                2.	Accessing native libs (C and C++)
            - Java and C++ communicate by using Java Native Interface (JNI) [https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides]
                - What is JNI
                - Why I need this

        % -	Server (and Cloud) is replaced by Mobile Computing [http://tinyurl.com/y6vusamh]
        % -	Mobile edge cloud [http://tinyurl.com/y7umteqg]

    \section{Parallel Computing}
        -	What is parallel computing
        -	Why I need it
        -	How it works
            - new Thread() vs ThreadPool
            - Insert general picture about Parallel computing
        -	Why it benefits for Android


    \section{Specification}
        -	Samsung S10+
        -	Android 10
        -	API Level 29
        -	8 Cores
            - 2 ARM Cortex-A75 2.73GHz
            - 4 ARM Cortex-A55 1.95GHz
            - 2 Samsung Exynos M4 1.95 GHz
        -	RAM 8 GB


    \section{Existing Applications}
        1.	Object Detector
            -	250-300 ms per frame
            -	Live camera
        2.	Computer Vision Detection
            -	Don’t know about (ms per frame) or (frame per second)
            -	Live camera – not smooth
            -	Lots of features including face detection
            -	Problem is it still delay
