\chapter{Implement}\label{implement}

    \section{Introduction}
        - System Overview – What I am going to use and implement
                - This project is implemented on Android Operating System, and Java is used as programming language
        - Implementation is divided into 3 layers
                - Java
                    - Process by using CPU
                        - Multithreading by using CPU
                    - Interact and handle evert from user
                    - Manage resource (Ex. Video files, Model Files)
                    - I/O (Ex. Camera, read file, write File)
                    - Permission (Internal and External Storage, Camera)
                    - Each method has to call Native Lib (OpenCV) via JNI

                - Java Native Interface (JNI)
                    - Perform as intermediate connection between Java and C++
                    - JNI is developed by using Native Development Kit (NDK)
                        - And NDK will compile C or C++ into native library by using CMake
                - C++
                    - Process by using GPU
                        - Multithreading by using GPU
                    - Directly access to memory
                    - Able to Call OpenCV and other libs without JNI

    \section{Deep Neutral Network}
        -	There are 2 model which are used for doing forward propagation
            - YOLO3 Model
            - Mobilenet SSD Model

        -	How DNN is implemented
            - DNN is implemented by using OpenCV, and there are steps of processing
                - Video -> Image -> Mat
                - blobFromImage
                - setInput
                - net.forward (forward propagation)
                - determine classification and confidence(accuracy)
                - NMSBox
                - Calculate Distance

    \section{Deep Neutral Network}
        -	Intro about parallelisation – How it works in Android
            - Thread vs ThreadPool
            - Handler
        -	Multithreading and Multicore
        -	System overview (Manager – Task – Runnable)
            - <Insert diagram>
        -	1 frame per 1 thread
            - <Insert diagram>

    \section{Parallelisation}
        -	Intro about parallelisation – How it works in Android
            - Thread vs ThreadPool
            - Handler
        -	Multithreading and Multicore
        -	System overview (Manager – Task – Runnable)
            - <Insert diagram>
        -	1 frame per 1 thread
            - <Insert diagram>

        \subsection{Multitheading with CPU}
            -	How to implement
                - Using Java
                - Thread pool
                    <insert sample of code>
            -	Memory Management
                - Singleton Pattern
                - Static block
                    - Executed only once
                - Queue and recycling
