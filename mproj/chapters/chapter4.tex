\chapter{Implement}\label{implement}

    In this chapter, the implementation details of each modules will be explained.

    \section{Android Application}
            According to Android Developer Guide \cite{ANDROID-01},
            Native Development Kit (NDK) is recommended for compiling C and C++ coode into native library,
            which is able to achieve a higher performance.
            - Improve the performace -> directly access to memeory address by using pointer.
            - How Java interact with C++
                - insert code.
            - How to show processed frame from live stream?
                - insert image

    \section{Human Detection}
        -	There are 2 model which are used for doing forward propagation
            - YOLO3 Model
            - Mobilenet SSD Model
            - Confidence threashold  level
                - YOLO Able to detect person with confidence threshold 0.5
                - SSD Able to detect person with confidence threshold 0.3

        -	How DNN is implemented
            - DNN is implemented by using OpenCV, and there are steps of processing
                - Video -> Image -> Mat
                - blobFromImage
                - setInput
                - net.forward (forward propagation)
                - determine classification and confidence(accuracy)
                - NMSBox
                - Calculate Distance

        \section{Distance Calculation}
            -	There are 2 model which are used for doing forward propagation
                - YOLO3 Model
                - Mobilenet SSD Model

            -	How DNN is implemented
                - DNN is implemented by using OpenCV, and there are steps of processing
                    - Video -> Image -> Mat
                    - blobFromImage
                    - setInput
                    - net.forward (forward propagation)
                    - determine classification and confidence(accuracy)
                    - NMSBox
                    - Calculate Distance

    \section{Parallelisation}
        -	Intro about parallelisation – How it works in Android
            - Thread vs ThreadPool
            - Handler
        -	Multithreading and Multicore
        -	System overview (Manager – Task – Runnable)
            - <Insert diagram>
        -	1 frame per 1 thread
            - <Insert diagram>

        \subsection{Multitheading with CPU}
            -	How to implement
                - Using Java
                - Thread pool
                    <insert sample of code>
            -	Memory Management
                - Singleton Pattern
                - Static block
                    - Executed only once
                - Queue and recycling
