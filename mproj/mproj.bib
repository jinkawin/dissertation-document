    abstract        = {Influenza virus infections are believed to spread mostly by close contact in the community. Social distancing measures are essential components of the public health response to influenza pandemics. The objective of these mitigation measures is to reduce transmission, thereby delaying the epidemic peak, reducing the size of the epidemic peak, and spreading cases over a longer time to relieve pressure on the healthcare system. We conducted systematic reviews of the evidence base for effectiveness of multiple mitigation measures: isolating ill persons, contact tracing, quarantining exposed persons, school closures, workplace measures/closures, and avoiding crowding. Evidence supporting the effectiveness of these measures was obtained largely from observational studies and simulation studies. Voluntary isolation at home might be a more feasible social distancing measure, and pandemic plans should consider how to facilitate this measure. More drastic social distancing measures might be reserved for severe pandemics.},

    abstract        = {Because floating-point computation is the heart of 3D geometry, speeding up floating-point computation is vital to overall 3D performance. To produce a visually perceptible difference in graphics applications, Intel's 32-bit processors--based on the IA-32 architecture--required an increase of 1.5 to 2 times the native floating-point performance. One path to better performance involves studying how the system uses data. Today's 3D applications can execute a lot faster by differentiating between data used repeatedly and streaming data--data used only once and discarded. Pentium III's new floating- point extension lets programmers designate data as streaming and provides instructions that handle this data efficiently. The authors designed the Internet Streaming SIMD Extensions to enable a new level of visual computing on the volume PC platform. They discuss their results in terms of boosting the performance of 3D and video applications.},
