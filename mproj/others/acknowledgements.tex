\section*{Acknowledgements}
    I would like to express my very great appreciation to my supervisor,
    Dr Jose Cano Reyes, for his mentorship throughout a whole duration of this project.
    This dissertation would not be completed without the guidance of my supervisor.
    He always provided me with very invaluable advice,
    and he couraged me when I struggled in troubles;
    these have been very much appreciated.

    I would like to thank my family for their love and the opportunity of studying a master degree that I have given for a whole year. It is the most valuable experience in my life.
    Last but not least, I would like to thank my friends who have supported and encouraged me during
    the past year.
